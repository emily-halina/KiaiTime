# KiaiTime

KiaiTime is a co-creative AI editor that allows users to create Taiko charts with the assistance of AI agents that learn from the user.

This repository will contain the SRC for KiaiTime, a set of instructions on how to run the system yourself / with an arbitrary AI partner, as well as supplementary materials for an IJCAI-ECAI 2022 paper. (WIP)

Update: (Jan. 19, 2024) 

Added executable downloads of tool and server code for interfacing with KiaiTime. For Taikonation models, please see https://github.com/emily-halina/TaikoNationV1.
