# KiaiTime

KiaiTime is a co-creative AI editor that allows users to create Taiko charts with the assistance of AI agents that learn from the user.

This repository will contain the SRC for KiaiTime, a set of instructions on how to run the system yourself / with an arbitrary AI partner, as well as supplementary materials for an IJCAI-ECAI 2022 paper. (WIP)
